The intent of this project is to download Sites information via Google’s API. I put together this code because of two reasons:
  1. Google’s support of .Net is lacking. Python became the path of least resistance.
  1. There is an undocumented limit of 500 results per site feed request imposed by Google. They have a “max-results” option which one would believe actually returns all results, but it doesn’t.

Disclaimer: I do not claim to be a Python developer. This was my first stab at Python so you use this at your own risk. If you have any suggestions for improvement please contact me: robertcaretta@gmail.com
